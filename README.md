## This Repository

This repo contains the official **VCMC Plugin for Java servers with Geyser** — the `.jar` file that enables proximity voice chat on Java servers with cross-play support for Bedrock players.

👉 **[Download latest Plugin release →](../../releases/latest)**

## What is VCMC?

VCMC is a **free proximity voice chat app for Minecraft**. Talk to nearby players in real time — the further away they are, the quieter they sound.

Originally built for **Minecraft Bedrock**, VCMC now also supports **Java servers via the Geyser plugin**. No Discord, no external calls, no complex configuration. Just open the app, paste one command in the Minecraft chat, and you're talking.

## App Interface

### First Launch
On first launch VCMC asks for **microphone permission** — required for voice chat to work. After granting it, you reach the main menu.

From the main menu you can:
- **Download the Addon** directly to your device
- Open **World Rooms** — for local Minecraft worlds
- Open **Server Rooms** — for Bedrock or Java servers

### World Rooms
Use this when you are hosting or joining a local Minecraft world.

- **Host:** Tap **MY WORLD** to create a room. The app gives you a command to paste in Minecraft chat.
- **Friends:** Tap **+**, enter the host's Gamertag, and join their room. No command needed on their side.

### Server Rooms
Use this for dedicated Bedrock or Java (Geyser) servers.

Enter the server IP and port — VCMC generates the Room ID automatically. Each player pastes the given command in chat once and voice is active.

### Floating Bubble (Overlay)
Once connected, a small floating bubble stays visible over every app including Minecraft. No need to switch apps to manage your mic.

| Bubble state | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Connected — microphone active |
| 🔴 Red | Muted |
| 🔌 Plug icon | Disconnected from Minecraft |

Tap the bubble to toggle mute. Long-press to reposition it anywhere on screen.

### In-Game Indicators *(unique to VCMC)*
- A **message appears on your Minecraft screen** every time you mute or unmute
- A **symbol next to your nametag** shows your mic state to nearby players in real time

## How to Use

### Mode 1 — Local World (Bedrock)

1. **Host:** Open VCMC → tap **MY WORLD** → a room is created.
2. **Friends:** Open VCMC → tap **+** → enter the host's Gamertag → join the room.
3. **Host:** Install the **World** behavior pack in your Minecraft world. In world settings → General: enable Websockets and disable "Encrypted Websockets only".
4. **Host:** Open the floating bubble → copy the link → paste it in the Minecraft chat.
5. ✅ Everyone hears each other with proximity audio.

> Only the host installs the addon and pastes the command. Friends only join the room in the app.

### Mode 2 — Bedrock Server

1. Upload the **Server** behavior pack + resource pack to your server.
2. For non-Aternos servers, add `@minecraft/server-net` to `config/default/permissions.json`.
3. Players open VCMC → **SERVER** → enter IP and port.
4. Each player pastes the command shown in the app into Minecraft chat.
5. ✅ Proximity voice chat is active.

### Mode 3 — Java Server with Geyser

1. Drop the VCMC `.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder and restart.
2. The plugin prints the server IP and Room ID in the console at startup.
3. Players open VCMC → **SERVER** → enter the IP:port from the console.
4. ✅ Works for both Java and Bedrock players on the same server.
